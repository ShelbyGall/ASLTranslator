**Project Name:**\
    ASLTranslator
    

**Project Description:**\
    This is the COMP 490/491 ASL Translator project. The purpose of this project is to provide a way for people to learn/test people on ASL Alphabet translations 
    using the power of OpenCV. Our project first started as a website, but we decided to scale the project back a little bit and make a desktop app. The program has two modes.
    A Training Mode and Challenge mode. The Training Mode allows users to learn the ASL alphabet. The Challenge mode gamifies the learning process and 
    allows users to test their knowledge on ASL Translations. Please see the installation and program execution instructions below.
